# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning
# Project Overview
This project aims to enhance credit card fraud detection and credit risk assessment through machine learning techniques. It employs various models, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Network, and Naive Bayes, to identify fraudulent activities and assess credit risk more effectively.

# Techniques Used
Data Preprocessing: Implemented data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature selection.
Balancing Techniques: Utilized ADASYN and SMOTE for addressing class imbalance.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated classifiers using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized models through grid search to enhance performance.
# Key Results
Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 97%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling imbalanced datasets and detecting fraud.
Model Performance Improvement: Significant accuracy improvements were observed across classifiers with balanced data and hyperparameter tuning.
# Insights
The combination of SMOTE oversampling and cross-validation proved most effective in enhancing model performance.
The Random Forest model demonstrated robust performance in identifying fraudulent credit card applications.
